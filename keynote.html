  <p class="body">Sanjeev Chandra is a Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto, which he joined after receiving his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1990. Prof. Chandra is known internationally for his research on the dynamics of droplets and sprays and is one of the founders of the Centre for Advanced Coating Technologies at the University of Toronto. His research spans the areas of fluid mechanics, heat transfer and materials science and has also been applied in spray coating, spray cooling, spray painting, ink-jet printing, electronic cooling and waste heat recovery. Prof. Chandra has published over 200 papers in referred journals and international conference proceedings. He has written an undergraduate textbook on thermodynamics and several chapters for books on the subjects of thermal spray coating, heat transfer and sprays. In 2010 he was awarded the The Brockhouse Canada Prize for Interdisciplinary Research, awarded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to recognize outstanding collaborative research. In 2015 he was awarded the Jules Stachiewicz Medal by the Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering for outstanding contributions to heat transfer. He is a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering and  the  American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
