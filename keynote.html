  <p class="body">Professor Antonio Moreira received his Ph. D. in Experimental Combustion from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico of the University of Lisbon where he is currently Associate Professor with Habilitation at the Mechanical Engineering Department. His main academic and research interests are in the areas of Thermofluids, Combustion and Energy Systems having developed research on the use of advanced techniques for fluid dynamics studies. Recently his research activities focus on the multi-scale transport phenomena occurring at solid-liquid interfaces with innovative potential for multidisciplinary application domains. In this area, he founded the Laboratory of Micro Scale Interfacial Phenomena at the Mechanical Engineering Department of IST. He coordinated and/or participated in multiple R&D projects in energy and micro-fluidics, he has given keynote lectures at international conferences in enhanced heat transfer and has published more than 170 research papers in conference proceedings and journals with peer review. Besides serving on the Organizing Committee of several International Conferences in fluid dynamics, heat and mass transfer, he is a member of the Scientific Council of the ICHMT and Chairman of the International Symposium on Applications of Laser Techniques to Fluid Mechanics and Director of the Center for Innovation, Technology and Policy Research (IN+).</p>
